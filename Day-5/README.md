## Day 5 Pthon Loops

1. **while Loop in Python**
   - Loops are used to repeat instructions.
   - `while` loop executes till the condition is `True`
   - `while` Loops
     - ```
       while condition:
         statements
       ```
   - **Break & Continue** With-in while loop
     - `break` used to terminate the loop when encountered.
     - `continue` terminates execution in the current iteration & continues exection of the loop with next iteration.

2. **for Loop in Python**
   - Used for sequential traversal. For traversing list, string, tuples etc.
   - Example
     ```
     list = [1,2,3]

     for el in list:
        print(el)
     ```
