     -  Avoids redundancy and reusability.

2. **Class & Object in Python**
   - class is a blueprint for creating Object. Blueprint tells how the object should be created. Example addmission of a student. To get the student admitted we have to collect details such as his name, age, address, contact details, etc..
   - class name always starts with Capital character such as `Student`
   ```
   # Creating class
   class Student:
     name = "Arhan"
   ```
   ```
   # Creating Object (Instance) of the class
   s1 = Student()
   print(s1.name)
   ```
