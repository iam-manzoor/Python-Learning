# Will see how to define List in python

# List can store different data types such as string, int, float, another list, dict.
diff_elements["Arhan", 12, 3.9]
print(diff_elements)
print(type(diff_elements)

# List stores int data types
marks = [100,99,98,97,96]

# Print List
print(marks)

# Lenght of List. Same as string
print(len(marks))

# Indexing in List. Simillar to string, starts from 0
print(marks[0])  # Prints 100
print(marks[4])  # Prints 96
