## Day 3 List & Tuple in Python

1. **Lists in Python**
- A built-in data type that stores set of values. Its sort of equalant to Array's in other programming languages.
- A list can store different types of elements. (String, intigger, float, list, dict)
  - Example `student=["Arhan",10,2.0]`
- String is immutable but the List's in Python is mutable.
  - **List slicing**
    - Example `list_name[starting_idx:ending_idx]` #Ending idx is not included.
    - Slicing result will get sublist.
